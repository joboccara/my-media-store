* about concepts:
  * extracting a service: 👍
  * hiding implementation details: reusing the Product models seems easy, hides params but we keep coupling with AR
  * classes interaction: not much to discover here
* last test doesn't bring much additional value: test 'return an error with missing attributes sorted alphabetically'
