* Lost a lot of time in technical details: migration, jbuilder 
  * -> we'll have to **make sure to help attendees on this** so they don't lose time
  * [ ] TODO: Need to do beforehand the different implementations with details tables, STI or distinct tables
* This iteration brings mostly the discussion about modeling, not much more
* I didn't introduce a DTO, but here it wouldn't have help much (the jbuilder plays this role)
  * [ ] **Exposing the price in the products controller would emphasize much more the need of a Repository and DTOs**
* Bring the question about Ubiquitous language, renaming item to product seems useful
