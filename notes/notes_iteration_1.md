- Without design achieved in ~20â€™
- More design in 15' more minutes
- Debrief questions
    - this iteration can be achieved without any specific concept: do we want already to add concepts in our standards? 
    - Can emerge:
        - Separation of concerns:
            - Where do you compute the price?
            - How do you decide which price is applied?
        - Hiding implementation details (not passing the entire product everywhere)
        - Removing external dependencies 
          - (Time and ENV variable) -> make them explicit by using the constructor
          - Passing a product to the Pricer rather than having the Pricer calling the DB
- Improvement: what about not having all product types using the premium rule to encourage composition of rules 
  - eg. `'premium video are not more expensive during the night'`
