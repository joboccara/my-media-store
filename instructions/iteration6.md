# Iteration 6: purchase

Sales are growing, it's great. Customers are now asking for their purchase invoices.
In this iteration we will build an invoicing system to keep track of purchases.

Implement `index` and `create` endpoints in the `purchases_controller`, creating and listing user invoices.

Unskip tests from `iteration_6_test.rb` and fix what it's needed.
